- Hello Jayanth!
- Today I worked on a small thing.
- May be It will help to solve the 3rd problem of advent of code 2019.
- I wrote a code to find equation of line in:

1. Slop and point form.
2. Two point form.

- And to simplify these equations :

1. I wrote simplifyEquation to simplify a given equation.
2. And simplify to simplify the bunch of numbers.

- And to find the point of intersection of two linear equation.

1. I wrote pointOfIntersection function.

- I write this because Bhanu and I had a conversion regarding 3rd problem. He
  told that he want to solve by finding the equation of lines by the given
  points and then by finding the point of intersection of lines.

- I want you to go through this and let me know your opinion, feedback, or any
  advice
